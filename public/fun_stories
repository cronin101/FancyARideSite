I quite fancy cycling the cancel route into town.

I had my bike stolen, really gutted!

I don't have a bike so no.

I've heard so many horror stories I'm not sure whether I should get a bike, even though I dolike cycling

I was cycling to Loch Lomand with my girlfriend and some Ned's started throwing sticks and rocks at us.  My girlfriend was OK but I got stuff thrown at me.

I only ever cycle out of the city, I do enjoy it but the city is scary

Never cycled in Glasgow!  Don't cycle because I'm absolutely convinced I'd die.

I cycled in Romania but we can cycle on the street there you can't here so I haven't.

I like the Dumbarton/Balloch cycle path.  It's flat there's completely closed.  Got young kids now so haven't done it for ages.  I use to go down with a family friend have a drink in the pub then get the train back.

I was cut off at lights by a taxi driver, caught up with him and kicked his door. I tell my friends about that.

Got knocked off.  Cycling up Sauchiehall street and driver honked his horn and I slipped my chain and got bumped by the car.  The guy drove off and I was left on the ground.  I didn't report it.  I've not stopped cycling.

Never cycled in Glasgow.  Cycled back home in Spain.  Glasgow roads are too scary.

I don't cycle any more - the drivers are way too angry and there are too many bumps.  I use to do Scotston to City Centre via Partick but it became impossible 'cause there was no cycle lanes.
